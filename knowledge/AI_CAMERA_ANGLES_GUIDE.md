# AI Camera Control & Storytelling Guide

*Based on "The NEW Way to Create Every Camera Angle in Nano Banana PRO"*

## Core Concept
Start with a single **Full Body Shot** (reference image) to maintain character consistency (face, clothing, body shape). Use this reference to generate all other angles.

## Camera Shots (Distance)
*   **Full Body Shot:** Shows character from head to toe.
    *   *Prompt:* "zoom out a little bit to show the [character] standing and wearing [clothing]"
*   **Close-up Shot:** Highlights specific parts (hand, face, belt).
    *   *Prompt:* "close-up shot on the [body part] of the [character]"
    *   *Note:* For faces, describe the lighting/environment to match the original shot (e.g., "light gray dreary day with subtle orange light").
*   **Extreme Close-up:** Very tight focus (eye, nose bridge).
    *   *Prompt:* "extreme close-up shot on her left eye"
*   **Extreme Long Shot:** Character is tiny against a vast background.
    *   *Prompt:* "extreme long shot"

## Camera Angles (Perspective)
*   **Off-Center Shot:** Places character to the side.
    *   *Prompt:* "an off-centered image of the character"
*   **Low Angle Shot:** Camera looks up at character (Power, Dominance).
    *   *Prompt:* "a low angle shot of her seen from below"
*   **High Angle Shot:** Camera looks down at character (Vulnerability).
    *   *Prompt:* "high angle shot of her seen from above"
*   **Side Profile:** Viewing character from the side.
    *   *Prompt:* "side profile shot"
*   **Rear View:** Viewing character from behind (Mystery).
    *   *Prompt:* "photo of her seen from behind"
*   **Dutch Angle:** Tilted camera (Unease, Tension).
    *   *Prompt:* "tilted angle" or "Dutch angle"
*   **Over-the-Shoulder:** Behind character, looking at what they see.
    *   *Prompt:* "an over the shoulder shot looking towards..."
*   **Point of View (POV):** Seeing through the character's eyes.
    *   *Prompt:* "point of view shot"

## Camera Movements (Video)
*   **Orbit/Rotate:** Camera circles the character.
    *   *Prompt:* "camera orbit around her"
*   **Tilt:** Camera moves up/down.
    *   *Prompt:* "tilt up towards the sky"
*   **Shaky Handheld:** Adds realism/action vibe.
    *   *Prompt:* "shaky handheld camera"
*   **Start & End Frame:** Chain shots together (e.g., Full Body -> Close-up Smirk).
    *   *Technique:* Use a full body shot as start frame and a close-up as end frame.

## Advanced Techniques
*   **Layering Angles:** Combine prompts (e.g., "seen from behind" + "high angle shot").
*   **Inpainting/Editing:** Fix details (e.g., "pull her arm down") directly in the chat editor.
*   **Multi-Character Scenes:** Generate characters separately, then composite or prompt them together (e.g., "over the shoulder shot looking towards the Sith").
