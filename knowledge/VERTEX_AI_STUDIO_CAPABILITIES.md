# Vertex AI Studio Capabilities

Vertex AI Studio offers an efficient experience for discovering and refining models, settings, system instructions, and prompt refinement through built-in experiences and a dedicated collaborative workspace environment.

This page outlines the key features implemented within Vertex AI Studio that facilitate transforming innovative ideas into generative AI solutions, for example, solutions that benefit customer service and support, content creation, healthcare, financial services, and software development.

## Roles
You can control which Google Cloud services that users can access through Vertex AI Studio by assigning the following roles:

| Role | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Administrator** | Responsible for Google Cloud setup that interacts with agents using technical language to connect Vertex AI with the Google Cloud ecosystem. |
| **Builder** | Includes the ML developers and App developers, who use the developer tools. Agents use developer-specific language with a scope limited to Vertex AI. |

| **Undo or Redo** | Undo or redo functionality is available for actions like model settings and prompt changes. |
| **In-App help tool** | An in-app help tool accessible through the `/ask` command or the prompt field. |
| **Prompt gallery** | An updated prompt gallery with app samples. |

### Built-in tools and capabilities
This section lists the built-in tools and capabilities within Vertex AI Studio that automate a significant portion of the work for developers. Vertex AI Studio integrates with Google Cloud, which provides an effortless experience that's collaborative and agentic.

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Natural language refinement** | For prompt refinement, you can describe how you want to change your prompt using natural language, and the system automatically optimizes the prompt for you. |
| **Optimize system instruction** | You can use a one-click feature that asks Gemini to automatically optimize a system instruction based on the prompt. |
| **Refine prompt response** | You can use the `/prompt` command to provide feedback and to create a well-formatted revised prompt. |
| **Help-me-write tool** | You can use the `/prompt` command and a described intent to create a well-formatted prompt, system instruction, and to recommend a model. |
