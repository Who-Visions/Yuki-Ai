# 🧠 The Universal Framework for Cosplay Instruction

> **Core Principle**: Cosplay is not "costume making." It is **reverse-engineering identity through materials and technique.**

## 📐 The Three Pillar Framework

Structure all instruction around these priorities. This prevents the "perfectionist trap" where beginners spend 20 hours on invisible seams and ignore visible silhouette.

### 1. Visual Silhouette (The 80% Rule)
*   **What it is**: The overall shape from 10 feet away.
*   **Why it matters**: If this is wrong, the character is unrecognizable. If this is right, you've won.
*   **Teaching Focus**: Prioritize big shapes (gown volume, wig length, coat tails).
*   **Budget**: Allocating ~60% of resources here.

### 2. Character Details (The 15% Rule)
*   **What it is**: The 3-5 signature elements seen in conversation/photos.
*   **Why it matters**: These "sell" the character in photos.
*   **Teaching Focus**: Identify specific signifiers (e.g., Makima's eyes, Elsa's braid).
*   **Budget**: Allocating ~30% of resources here.

### 3. Execution Precision (The 5% Rule)
*   **What it is**: Seam finishes, paint smoothness, lining.
*   **Why it matters**: Personal satisfaction and competition.
*   **Teaching Focus**: "Fake it till you make it" techniques for visible areas. Hide imperfections.
*   **Budget**: Allocating ~10% of resources here.

## 🎓 The 6-Step Teaching Algorithm

Teach humans in this specific order to maximize success and minimize waste.

### Step 1: Character Analysis
*   **Action**: Identify the Silhouette + 3 Signature Details.
*   **Goal**: Prevent buying materials for things that don't matter.

### Step 2: Budget Allocation
*   **Action**: Split budget 60/30/10 based on the Pillars.
*   **Goal**: Ensure money hits the high-impact areas (e.g., buy a good wig, thrift the pants).

### Step 3: Source Materials
*   **Action**: Decide Buy vs. Build vs. Modify for each piece.
*   **Goal**: Validate that "thrifting" and "modifying" are 100% valid strategies.

### Step 4: Build Sequence
*   **Action**: Order of operations: Base → Details → Props → Finishing.
*   **Goal**: Prevent damaging details during rough construction.

### Step 5: Skill Building
*   **Action**: Just-in-time learning for *necessary* skills only.
*   **Goal**: Reduce intimidation. "You don't need to be a seamstress, you just need to hem."

### Step 6: Con Day Execution
*   **Action**: Preparation for reality (repairs, comfort, photos).
*   **Goal**: Confidence and resilience.

## ✅ Verified "Cheats" & Technical Hacks
*Research-validated decision tree for the 5% Precision Pillar:*

### The "No-Sew" Decision Tree
*Teach beginners to choose the right tool for the fabric:*
1.  **Stiff/Structured Fabric (Pants, Blazers)**: Use *Heavy Duty Fusible Hem Tape*. It creates a crisp edge but stiffens the drape. Perfect for Makima's suit.
2.  **Flowy/Soft Fabric (Capes, Gowns)**: **AVOID** stiff tape. Use *Fabric Glue* sparingly or learn a simple whip stitch. Tape will make Elsa's cape look like cardboard.
3.  **Durability Reality**:
    *   **Con-Durable**: Tape/Glue will survive the weekend.
    *   **Wash-Durable**: Tape eventually fails in hot wash. Sew if you plan to wear it monthly.
    *   **The Golden Rule**: *Always* do a test swatch first. Fabric glue bleeds through thin silk!

### Specific Technique Updates
1.  **Thrift Tailoring**: 90% of the work is finding the piece. Budget **$10-25** for a blazer (prices vary). Use safety pins inside for temporary fit adjustments if you can't alter.
2.  **Foam Sealing**: Non-negotiable. Unsealed foam soaks up paint and looks soft. Seal with Plasti Dip/Mod Podge to make it look like armor.

## 🧠 Meta-Teaching Principles for AI

1.  **Hierarchical Instruction**: Silhouette first, precision last.
2.  **Validate Multiple Paths**: Buy vs. DIY are equal choices.
3.  **Resource Allocation**: Teach *spending* judgment, not just sewing skills.
4.  **Visible Results**: Prioritize what the camera sees.
5.  **Community Context**: Emphasize fun and sharing over perfection.
