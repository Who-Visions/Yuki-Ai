*   **Real World Knowledge:** Built-in knowledge of celebrities (athletes like LeBron, Ronaldo), landmarks, GPS coordinates, and biological species.
*   **Multimodal Understanding:** Can analyze images to solve riddles, explain landmarks, deconstruct objects into assembly diagrams, and infer internal structures from external views.
*   **Interior Design:** Can transform raw SketchUp renders or empty room photos into realistic concept visuals, respecting geometry and lighting.
*   **Storytelling & Video:** Can analyze viral videos to extract storytelling frameworks (4 Ts: Hook, Peak, Form, Twist), generate scripts, storyboards, and consistent scenes for video creation.

## Workflows

### 1. Flawless Product & Text Integration
*   **Technique:** Upload a product reference or text brief.
*   **Text Editing:** "Change the text in this image to [New Text] while keeping the font and style."
*   **Typography:** Request specific fonts (Script, Handwritten, Bebas) or styles (Tattoo illustration).
*   **Bilingual:** "Generate a menu in both English and Arabic."

### 2. Brand Style & Guidelines
*   **Technique:** Upload brand guidelines (logos, hex codes, fonts) as reference images (up to 14 images supported).
*   **Prompt:** "Change the design of this poster to match the brand identity outlined."
*   **Web Design:** Generate a flat logo, evolve it to geometric, design a web page layout, mock it up on a MacBook, and even translate the page content.

### 3. Storyboarding & Script-to-Visual
*   **Technique:** Upload a written story or script (screenshot or text) and ask for a cinematic sequence.
*   **Prompt:** "Generate a cinematic photorealistic sequence for this story. All frames 16x9."
*   **Collage Method:** Merge up to 25 items into a single consistent image for complex scenes.
*   **Viral Video Analysis:** Upload a viral video + prompt to analyze its storytelling structure (Hook, Peak, Form, Twist) and generate a new script based on that structure.
*   **Scene Generation:** "Analyze this storyboard and give me prompts for each scene." Then generate consistent images for each scene to be animated.
*   **Knolling Animation:** Generate a "knolling" image (organized items), then an empty table image. Use video AI to animate hands placing items.
*   **Visual Narrative:** "Create a sequence of cinematic shots... Frame 1: [Description], Frame 2: [Description]." Extract specific stills for further animation.
*   **Multi-Frame Transitions:** Generate intermediate frames (e.g., Close-up -> High Angle -> Driver POV) to help video AI tools interpolate complex camera moves.

### 4. Cinematic Advertising & Motion Prep
*   **Hyper-Realism Prompts:** Use specific camera gear and lighting details for ad-quality shots.
    *   *Example:* "Sony A7R, rich bokeh, crisp facial detail, dark moody aesthetic, deep contrast, extreme close-up of eyes locked in focus, sweat glistening, arena lights reflected."
*   **Motion Transitions:** Generate specific "Start" and "End" frames for video generation tools (like Kling AI or Veo).
    *   *Technique:* Generate Frame A (Basketball in hands) and Frame B (Football at feet) to guide morphing transitions.
*   **Athlete/Celebrity Ads:** Leverage built-in knowledge of famous athletes to create high-fidelity campaign shots without complex LoRAs.
*   **Product Ads:** Create studio shots (e.g., futuristic sneakers on water), show a model holding it in an Instagram story, and then wearing it while walking on water.

### 5. Technical Diagrams & Blueprints
*   **Assembly Diagrams:** Upload an image of a toy or object and ask for an "assembly diagram with labels."
*   **Blueprints:** Convert an image into a technical blueprint or deconstructed view (e.g., breaking down a jacket's materials).
*   **Code to Diagram:** Generate accurate architecture diagrams from code snippets (e.g., PyTorch).
*   **Inferential Sketching:** Upload external photos of a device and ask for "creative sketches that led to this design, emphasizing realism." The model can infer internal structures not visible in the photos.
*   **Die Lines:** Convert a die line image into a folded product view, or deconstruct a product into a die line (experimental).
*   **Anatomy Labeling:** Can accurately label complex biological anatomy (e.g., elephant organs) with correct arrows and text.
*   **Exploded Views:** Create an isometric view of a product separated into its components (e.g., mechanical carpet sweeper).

### 6. Style Transfer & Material Swapping
*   **Material Transfer:** "Apply the fabric texture from Image 2 onto the jacket in Image 1, keeping everything else the same."
*   **Creative Styles:** Gummy, Marble Statue, Gold, Chocolate, Origami, Charcoal Sketch.
*   **Style Transfer:** Apply the artistic style of one image to another.
*   **Creative Upscaling:** Upload a low-res image and ask to "upscale to 4K." It adds detail and hallucinates missing information creatively.
*   **Photo Restoration:** Repair, colorize, and upscale old photos (e.g., grandparents) to remove fading and damage.

### 7. Consistent Characters & "Fake" Reality
*   **Fake Camera Roll:** "Generate a camera roll of [Character] hanging out with friends, including selfies and amateur shots."
*   **Amateur Photography:** Use prompts like "unremarkable iPhone selfie," "careless snapshot," "motion blur," "mildly overexposed" for hyper-realism.
*   **Behind the Scenes:** "Generate a behind-the-scenes shot of this image showing the film crew." Or ask "Show me where the cameras and lights are placed" to analyze lighting setups (e.g., from a Godfather scene).
*   **Group Shots:** Realistic group photos of specific celebrities or characters.
*   **Internal Monologue:** "Give everyone in this image an internal monologue thought bubble."
*   **Pose Control:** Upload a sketch or reference image and ask the model to mimic the poses.
*   **Time Travel / Decades:** "Generate a 4x4 grid of me from 1880 to 2020s, showing clothing and style for each decade."
*   **Profile Transformation:** Turn a profile photo into a Pixar character, change gender, or place in a game UI (e.g., Sims).
*   **Contextual Profiles:** Take a generated character (e.g., from 1930s) and generate a realistic LinkedIn profile page for them.

### 8. Floor Plans & Architecture
*   **Technique:** Upload an image of a room to generate a 2D floor plan, or vice versa.
*   **Prompt:** "Generate a detailed 2D floor plan of the apartment."
*   **Interior Design:** Transform empty rooms into furnished concepts. "Add a rug, change the chair scale, change lighting to golden hour."
*   **SketchUp to Realism:** Upload a raw SketchUp export and a material reference. "Transform this raw render into a realistic concept using the materials from the reference image."
*   **Budget-Aware Mockups:** "Create a realistic mockup of this room renovation with a budget of $500."

### 9. Infographics & Educational Analysis
*   **Informative Explainers:** Upload a travel photo or animal picture and ask for an educational explanation/context.
*   **Infographics:** "Create an infographic explaining how to make a banana split, showing ingredients visually."
*   **Riddle Solver:** Upload an image of a riddle (e.g., on a whiteboard) and ask the model to solve it and explain the answer.
*   **Map Illustration:** Convert satellite imagery or maps into illustrated styles (e.g., GTA style, watercolor, RPG fantasy map, 8-bit retro).
*   **Mixologist:** "Create a cocktail recipe infographic for a [Cocktail Name]."
*   **Hairstyle Guide:** "Generate a grid of 10 hairstyles from the 1970s with names."
*   **Comparative Analysis:** Create infographics comparing characters (e.g., Gandalf vs. Frodo) analyzing goals, strengths, and weaknesses.

### 10. Print on Demand (POD) & Merchandise
*   **High Resolution:** Generates 2000x2000+ pixel images suitable for mugs, stickers, and apparel (with upscaling).
*   **Precise Editing:** "Change the skateboard pattern to camouflage." Can alter specific elements without changing the rest of the design.
*   **Concept Merging:** "Merge these two designs (Frog + Capybara) into one t-shirt graphic." The model intelligently blends concepts (e.g., animals sharing a drink).
*   **Mockup Manipulation:** "Change the shirt color to heather gray." Can adjust mockup colors while preserving the graphic (mostly).
*   **Puns & Humor:** Can generate puns (e.g., "Barely skating by") and integrate them into the design.
*   **Logo Merch:** Visualize a logo on various products (hoodies, mugs) and generate a realistic social media screenshot (e.g., TikTok) of a model showcasing them.
*   **Limitations:** *Cannot* generate true transparent backgrounds yet (generates a fake checkerboard). Use external tools to remove backgrounds.

### 11. Translation & Localization
*   **Technique:** Upload an image with text and ask to translate it while preserving the visual look.
*   **Prompt:** "Translate the text in this manga page to English."

### 12. Advanced Analysis
*   **Medical Analysis:** Detect lesions in medical scans.
*   **Data Visualization:** Turn a table of data into a bar graph.
*   **Game Remasters:** Remaster old video game screenshots into high-fidelity images.
*   **Thumbnail Selection:** Upload an edited video and ask the model to pick the best frame for a thumbnail.
*   **Website Mockups:** Generate a website design based on a wireframe or even a portfolio image.
*   **Lore Generation:** Upload an image and ask "Create the lore behind this image."
*   **Location Scouting:** Upload a photo of a location and ask for the exact GPS coordinates (highly accurate for known spots).

## Hidden Gems
*   **GPS Coordinates:** Generate realistic photos of specific locations using lat/long coordinates.
*   **Historical Recreation:** Recreate historical events (e.g., Columbus arriving) using date and coordinates.
*   **E-commerce:** Better proportions for apparel and shoes.
*   **Hidden Watermark:** Images contain SynthID for AI detection.
*   **Recursive Images:** Create looping/zooming effects by generating an image within a mockup within an image.
*   **Future OS:** "Generate a screenshot of an operating system from 85 years in the future."
*   **Annotations:** Use arrows and text on an image to give precise instructions (e.g., "Move penguin here").
*   **Image to 3D:** Generate a "vinyl toy" style image, then use a 3D generator (like Tripo or Hunyuan) to create a printable 3D model.
*   **Tileable Patterns:** "Generate a tileable pattern of [Subject]." Use tools to check seamlessness.
*   **Doodles:** "Add cute 2D playful doodles on this image interacting with the subject."
*   **Googly Eyes:** "Add googly eyes and cartoon arms to this object."
*   **Google Slides:** "Beautify this slide" feature to improve design and layout.

## Masterclass Tips (from "The Complete Masterclass")
*   **"Say What You See" Game:** Train your prompting skills by playing the "Say What You See" game (Google tool). Describe the medium, subject, and context to think like the model.
*   **Context Engineering:** For complex tasks (e.g., "History of Google AI"), do deep research first (Perplexity/Gemini), then paste the *text* results into the prompt. This lets the model focus on generation rather than research.
*   **Don't Patch a Bad Seed:** If an image edit goes wrong or facial consistency degrades after multiple turns, **reset the thread**. Start fresh with the last good image as a reference.
*   **Learning Nuclear Weapon:** Use Nano Banana Pro to generate infographics for everything you learn. Visuals + Text = 400% faster learning and 60,000x faster processing by the brain.
*   **Say "Please":** It actually helps with the pro model's reasoning and willingness to execute complex instructions!

## Startup Ideas (Enabled by Nano Banana Pro)
1.  **Cursor for Presentations:** A tool that generates/edits slides from plain English with high fidelity.
2.  **Professional Headshots App:** Upload selfies -> Get LinkedIn-ready professional headshots (already disrupting photographers).
3.  **Dating Profile Optimizer:** "Glow up" photos for dating apps (better lighting, clothes, locations).
4.  **Haircut/Makeup Tester:** Realistic "try before you buy" for hairstyles and makeup looks.
5.  **Visual Education Platform:** Automated generation of high-quality infographics for complex topics (Physics, Math, AI Research).
6.  **AI Research Visualizer:** Turn arXiv papers into single-page visual summaries.
7.  **YouTube Thumbnail AB Tester:** Auto-generate thumbnail variations (different expressions, shirt colors) for A/B testing.

## Advanced Workflows & Hidden Features (The "Nano Banana" Masterclass)

### 1. World Building from a Single Image
*   **Concept:** Take one character image and generate an entire narrative universe around them.
*   **Technique:**
    *   **Action Shots:** "Side profile of [Character] climbing into the cockpit..."
    *   **Perspective Shifts:** "Close-up of face," "Low angle from boots up," "High angle looking down."
    *   **Consistency:** If the model drifts, use the **Collage Method** (see below) or reset the thread with the original image as the anchor.
    *   **Video Transition:** Generate a "Start Frame" (Front view) and "End Frame" (Back view) to create seamless rotation videos in Veo/Kling.

### 2. The Collage Method (Fixing "Multi-Character" Issues)
*   **Problem:** Generating multiple specific characters in one shot often blends their features.
*   **Solution:** Create a crude collage in Canva/Photoshop placing your characters/objects where you want them.
*   **Prompt:** "Create a cohesive photorealistic image based on this collage. Keep character positions and clothing exactly as shown."
*   **Result:** The model "glues" them together with perfect lighting and interaction while maintaining separate identities.

### 3. Annotation Prompting ("The Red Arrow Hack")
*   **Technique:** Draw directly on your reference image.
    *   **Red Arrows:** Point to where you want an object.
    *   **Text Labels:** Write "Dragon here," "Temple ruins," "Stone well."
*   **Prompt:** "Complete the prompts in this image. Replace the red arrow with a [Object]..." or "Follow the annotations to build the scene."
*   **Use Case:** Interior design ("Paint this wall blue"), complex scene composition.

### 4. Lighting & Season Control
*   **Intent-Based Backgrounds:** Don't just say "change background to jungle." Say: "Change background to jungle *and adjust lighting to be dappled sunlight filtering through trees, casting green shadows on the subject.*"
*   **Time Travel:** "Change the time of day to **Dawn**" (Softest shadows, best for fixing harsh lighting).
*   **Season Swap:** "Change the season to Winter and *change their clothes to heavy coats*." (Crucial: explicitly ask for clothing changes).

### 5. Photoshop Integration (Contextual Task Bar)
*   **Selection is Key:** Select *only* the area you want to change (e.g., the shirt, the background).
*   **Generative Fill:** Use Nano Banana (Gemini) inside Photoshop for:
    *   **Restoration:** Select a damaged area -> "Restore and sharpen details."
    *   **Expansion:** Put a square image on a wide canvas, select the empty white space -> "Fill this area to match the photo."
    *   **Object Removal:** "Remove the people crossed out in red."

### 6. Creative "Hacks"
*   **The "Green Screen" Myth:** You don't strictly need a green screen. Just describe the lighting match perfectly.
*   **Stick Figure Guide:** Draw stick figures of a fight scene -> "Turn these stick figures into [Character A] and [Character B] fighting."
*   **Logo Embedding:** "Place this logo on a perfume bottle called 'Essence of Future'." -> "Now show an influencer holding that bottle."
*   **Isometric Views:** "Make image daytime and **isometric view**." Great for 3D model references (Meshy/Tripo).

## Pro Workflows (The "26 Tests" Masterclass)

### 1. The "Iterate Cheap, Finalize Expensive" Strategy
*   **Context:** Nano Banana Pro (Gemini 3 Pro) is significantly more expensive (~3x) than the Flash/Standard versions.
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  Use **Nano Banana (Gemini 2.5 Flash)** to iterate on your prompt structure, composition, and basic elements. It's fast and cheap.
    2.  Once the prompt is solid, switch to **Nano Banana Pro (Gemini 3 Pro)** for the final high-fidelity render (4K, better texture, logic).
    3.  **Result:** You save budget while still getting the premium output for the final asset.

### 2. The "Start & End Frame" Video Hack
*   **Concept:** Instead of hoping a video generator understands "turn around," generate the keyframes yourself.
*   **Technique:**
    1.  **Start Frame:** Generate your character facing forward.
    2.  **End Frame:** Generate the *same* character (using the same seed/reference) facing away or in a new pose.
    3.  **Video Generation:** Feed *both* images into Veo or Kling as "Start Frame" and "End Frame."
    4.  **Result:** The video model simply interpolates the movement between your two perfect images, guaranteeing the ending looks exactly how you want.

### 3. The "Reverse Shot" Generator
*   **Problem:** You have a shot of Character A talking to Character B, but you need the reverse angle (over the shoulder of B looking at A).
*   **Technique:**
    1.  Take your established scene image.
    2.  **Prompt:** "Reverse angle shot. Show the view from [Character A]'s perspective looking at [Character B]. Maintain scene details."
    3.  **Tip:** If it struggles, crop the "listener" from the original image and use them as a reference for the foreground in the new shot.

### 4. Extreme Close-Up "Smash Cuts"
*   **Technique:** Don't just prompt "close up."
    1.  Take your full-body reference image.
    2.  **Crop** it manually to just the face/eyes.
    3.  **Img2Img Prompt:** "Extreme close-up, high detail, cinematic lighting. Do not change expression."
    4.  **Use Case:** Anime-style "Smash Cuts" for dramatic dialogue emphasis.

### 5. The "Crop Top" Hack for Body Composition
*   **Issue:** Sometimes the model flattens body curves or changes body types to be "safer" or more generic when heavy clothing (like leather jackets) is involved.
*   **Fix:** Explicitly describe the fit of the clothing or use terms like "Crop Top" or "Fitted Bodysuit" to force the model to respect the character's underlying physique.
*   **Prompting:** "Do not alter bust, waist, or hip measurements" can sometimes work, but describing *fitted* clothing is often more effective at maintaining character consistency.

## Masterclass: The "151 Variations" Workflow (Video-to-Asset Pipeline)

### 1. The "Video Mine" Strategy
*   **Concept:** Instead of generating 100 static images and hoping for consistency, generate **one** video and extract 100 perfect frames.
*   **Technique:**
    1.  **Orbit:** "Camera orbits 360 degrees around [Character] while they stand still." -> Extract front, side, back, and 3/4 views.
    2.  **Walk Cycle:** "Full body shot of [Character] walking towards camera." -> Extract dynamic walking poses.
    3.  **Expression Bank:** "Close up on face, [Character] cycles through expressions: happy, sad, angry, surprised." -> Extract facial assets.
*   **Tooling:** Use Veo 3.1 or Kling for the video generation. Use a video player (like VLC or Chrome) to "Save Frame As" for the best assets.

### 2. The "Costume Transfer" Protocol
*   **Problem:** You have a character and a separate image of a costume (e.g., a beekeeper suit).
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  **Input 1 (Image Prompt):** The Costume Reference.
    2.  **Input 2 (Image Prompt):** A prop (optional, e.g., honeycomb).
    3.  **Base Image:** Your Consistent Character.
    4.  **Prompt:** "Put [Character] in this [Costume]. Keep the character's face exactly the same."
    5.  **Refinement:** If the face degrades, use the **MidJourney Editor** or **Nano Banana Inpainting** to paste the original face back onto the new costumed body.

### 3. The "Stitch Fix" for Faces
*   **Issue:** You have 5 variations of your character, but the faces are slightly "off" in 3 of them.
*   **Technique:**
    1.  Create a blank canvas in Photoshop/Canva.
    2.  Paste the "bad" images side-by-side with 1-2 "perfect" reference images.
    3.  **Img2Img Prompt:** "Side-by-side character sheet of the same boy. Fix the faces to match the reference."
    4.  **Why it works:** The model sees the "perfect" face in the context window and uses it as a ground truth to correct the distorted ones.

## Masterclass: The "Open Art" Consistency Protocol (Adapted)

### 1. The "Three-Tier" Character Creation
*   **Tier 1: Text Only (The Architect):** Start here. Define every detail: "Female alchemist, olive skin, curly black hair in messy bun, emerald eyes." Be specific to lock the seed concepts.
*   **Tier 2: Single Reference (The Anchor):** Once you have *one* perfect generation, use it as the "Anchor Image" for all future prompts.
*   **Tier 3: Multi-Reference (The Matrix):** For maximum stability, generate 8-10 images of the character (front, side, 3/4 view, close-up, full body). Feed *all* of them into the context window (or fine-tune a LoRA if available) to create a "bulletproof" character identity.

### 2. The "Character Weight" Concept
*   **Concept:** In tools like Open Art (and conceptually in Gemini prompts), you balance "Creativity" vs. "Consistency".
*   **Application:**
    *   **High Consistency (0.9):** "Keep face exactly consistent. Do not change features." -> Use for simple pose changes.
    *   **Lower Consistency (0.6):** "Same character but older/injured/different style." -> Allows the model flexibility to blend concepts while keeping the "vibe".

### 3. Multi-Character Interaction
*   **Challenge:** AI struggles to put two specific characters in one scene without blending them.
*   **Fix:**
    1.  **Generate Character A** on the left (transparent background or specific setting).
    2.  **Generate Character B** on the right.
    3.  **Composite** them roughly in Photoshop.
    4.  **Img2Img Pass:** "Two friends talking. [Character A description] on left, [Character B description] on right. Unified lighting."
    5.  **Result:** The model "glues" them together into a cohesive scene without blending their identities.

### 4. The "Camera Orbit" Animation Prompt
*   **Prompt Formula:** "Camera slowly orbits around [Character] as wind gently moves their hair. Cinematic lighting. High fidelity."
*   **Why:** Specifying *camera movement* (orbit, pan, zoom) + *environmental movement* (wind, rain) forces the video model to understand 3D depth, preventing the "flat image warping" effect.

## Masterclass: The "Storybook" Consistency Workflow

### 1. The "Memory Bank" Strategy
*   **Concept:** Don't rely on the model's short-term memory. Explicitly define and re-inject character data.
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  **Define:** Ask the model to generate a detailed character description (Appearance, Personality, Traits).
    2.  **Save:** Copy this description into a "Memory Bank" (a text file or pinned note).
    3.  **Inject:** For *every single prompt*, paste the full character description AND upload the reference image.
    4.  **Why:** "Always provide the appearance details again, even if you've saved them. It's better to be safe than sorry."

### 2. The "Scene Breakdown" Protocol
*   **Problem:** Asking for "Scene 1" often results in generic outputs.
*   **Technique:**
    1.  **Paste Story:** Feed the full story to the model.
    2.  **Breakdown:** "Break this story into 30 visual scenes."
    3.  **Pre-Visualization:** Before generating, ask: "Can you explain how you're going to create Scene 1? What details matter most?"
    4.  **Refine:** Read the explanation. If it misses the "star on the hoodie," correct it *before* generating the image.

### 3. The "Generative Expand" Ratio Fix
*   **Issue:** You generated a perfect square image, but you need 16:9 for a video.
*   **Fix:**
    1.  Do **NOT** try to stretch or crop it.
    2.  Open a 16:9 canvas in Photoshop (or use Nano Banana's "Outpainting").
    3.  Place the square image in the center.
    4.  **Prompt:** "Generative Fill" (or "Outpaint") to extend the background.
    5.  **Result:** You keep the perfect character consistency while getting the cinematic aspect ratio.

### 4. Expression Sheets for LoRA Training
*   **Concept:** If you need to train a custom model (Flux LoRA or similar), you need variety.
*   **Prompt:** "Give me 6 different facial expression sheets of this character in a 3:2 wide image ratio. [Happy, Sad, Angry, Surprised, Disgusted, Neutral]."
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  Generate the sheet.
    2.  Cut out each face.
    3.  Use these as the training dataset for your custom character model.

## Masterclass: Google Ecosystem & Traditional Art Secrets

### 1. The "Mixboard" Prototyping Method
*   **Tool:** Google Mixboard (Experimental).
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  **Brainstorming:** Upload your character. Type "Show this girl with different hairstyles."
    2.  **Layout:** It generates 3 variations. You can resize and group them on a canvas.
    3.  **Outfit Stacking:** Upload distinct items (e.g., "Pink Sneakers," "Orange Sunglasses," "Strapless Dress").
    4.  **Prompt:** "Girl wearing these items." (Tip: Combine all items into *one* single reference image before uploading to help the model understand the relationship).

### 2. The "Whisk" Precise Reference
*   **Tool:** Google Whisk (Labs).
*   **Feature:** "Precise Reference" toggle.
*   **Technique:**
    1.  Upload your character face.
    2.  Enable **Precise Reference**.
    3.  **Lock Seed:** If you get a style you like, lock the seed to generate variations (e.g., different aspect ratios) without losing the face.
    4.  **Editing:** Use the "Refine" tool to change background/lighting while keeping the subject locked.

### 3. Traditional Art Principles for AI
*   **Concept:** AI models are trained on art. Speaking the language of artists helps consistency.
*   **Prompting Tactics:**
    *   **Shape Language:** Describe the character's construction. "Face made of smooth round curves," "Sharp angular features," "Triangle shaped nose."
    *   **Distinct Features:** Give them a "glitch" or unique trait. "A scar on the left eyebrow," "Gap between front teeth." The model latches onto these anomalies as anchors for identity.
    *   **The "Model Sheet" Request:** explicitly ask for it. "Create a character model sheet with front, side, and back views. Neutral lighting. T-Pose."

## Masterclass: The "Traditional Art" Consistency Workflow

### 1. The "Shape Language" Foundation
*   **Concept:** AI models (like human artists) build faces from shapes.
*   **Prompting:** Don't just describe the face; describe the *geometry*.
    *   "Face constructed from soft round shapes."
    *   "Sharp, angular jawline with a triangular chin."
    *   "Big round nose, wide set eyes."
*   **Why:** This gives the model a "blueprint" to follow regardless of the angle.

### 2. The "Place and Trace" (Img2Img) Cheat
*   **Concept:** In animation, artists trace the previous frame to keep the model on-model. You can do this with AI.
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  **Base Image:** Take your perfect character generation.
    2.  **Rough Sketch:** Roughly sketch (or photoshop) the *new* pose you want over it (or next to it).
    3.  **Img2Img:** Upload this composite.
*   **Solution:** Create a crude collage in Canva/Photoshop placing your characters/objects where you want them.
*   **Prompt:** "Create a cohesive photorealistic image based on this collage. Keep character positions and clothing exactly as shown."
*   **Result:** The model "glues" them together with perfect lighting and interaction while maintaining separate identities.

### 3. Annotation Prompting ("The Red Arrow Hack")
*   **Technique:** Draw directly on your reference image.
    *   **Red Arrows:** Point to where you want an object.
    *   **Text Labels:** Write "Dragon here," "Temple ruins," "Stone well."
*   **Prompt:** "Complete the prompts in this image. Replace the red arrow with a [Object]..." or "Follow the annotations to build the scene."
*   **Use Case:** Interior design ("Paint this wall blue"), complex scene composition.

### 4. Lighting & Season Control
*   **Intent-Based Backgrounds:** Don't just say "change background to jungle." Say: "Change background to jungle *and adjust lighting to be dappled sunlight filtering through trees, casting green shadows on the subject.*"
*   **Time Travel:** "Change the time of day to **Dawn**" (Softest shadows, best for fixing harsh lighting).
*   **Season Swap:** "Change the season to Winter and *change their clothes to heavy coats*." (Crucial: explicitly ask for clothing changes).

### 5. Photoshop Integration (Contextual Task Bar)
*   **Selection is Key:** Select *only* the area you want to change (e.g., the shirt, the background).
*   **Generative Fill:** Use Nano Banana (Gemini) inside Photoshop for:
    *   **Restoration:** Select a damaged area -> "Restore and sharpen details."
    *   **Expansion:** Put a square image on a wide canvas, select the empty white space -> "Fill this area to match the photo."
    *   **Object Removal:** "Remove the people crossed out in red."

### 6. Creative "Hacks"
*   **The "Green Screen" Myth:** You don't strictly need a green screen. Just describe the lighting match perfectly.
*   **Stick Figure Guide:** Draw stick figures of a fight scene -> "Turn these stick figures into [Character A] and [Character B] fighting."
*   **Logo Embedding:** "Place this logo on a perfume bottle called 'Essence of Future'." -> "Now show an influencer holding that bottle."
*   **Isometric Views:** "Make image daytime and **isometric view**." Great for 3D model references (Meshy/Tripo).

## Pro Workflows (The "26 Tests" Masterclass)

### 1. The "Iterate Cheap, Finalize Expensive" Strategy
*   **Context:** Nano Banana Pro (Gemini 3 Pro) is significantly more expensive (~3x) than the Flash/Standard versions.
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  Use **Nano Banana (Gemini 2.5 Flash)** to iterate on your prompt structure, composition, and basic elements. It's fast and cheap.
    2.  Once the prompt is solid, switch to **Nano Banana Pro (Gemini 3 Pro)** for the final high-fidelity render (4K, better texture, logic).
    3.  **Result:** You save budget while still getting the premium output for the final asset.

### 2. The "Start & End Frame" Video Hack
*   **Concept:** Instead of hoping a video generator understands "turn around," generate the keyframes yourself.
*   **Technique:**
    1.  **Start Frame:** Generate your character facing forward.
    2.  **End Frame:** Generate the *same* character (using the same seed/reference) facing away or in a new pose.
    3.  **Video Generation:** Feed *both* images into Veo or Kling as "Start Frame" and "End Frame."
    4.  **Result:** The video model simply interpolates the movement between your two perfect images, guaranteeing the ending looks exactly how you want.

### 3. The "Reverse Shot" Generator
*   **Problem:** You have a shot of Character A talking to Character B, but you need the reverse angle (over the shoulder of B looking at A).
*   **Technique:**
    1.  Take your established scene image.
    2.  **Prompt:** "Reverse angle shot. Show the view from [Character A]'s perspective looking at [Character B]. Maintain scene details."
    3.  **Tip:** If it struggles, crop the "listener" from the original image and use them as a reference for the foreground in the new shot.

### 4. Extreme Close-Up "Smash Cuts"
*   **Technique:** Don't just prompt "close up."
    1.  Take your full-body reference image.
    2.  **Crop** it manually to just the face/eyes.
    3.  **Img2Img Prompt:** "Extreme close-up, high detail, cinematic lighting. Do not change expression."
    4.  **Use Case:** Anime-style "Smash Cuts" for dramatic dialogue emphasis.

### 5. The "Crop Top" Hack for Body Composition
*   **Issue:** Sometimes the model flattens body curves or changes body types to be "safer" or more generic when heavy clothing (like leather jackets) is involved.
*   **Fix:** Explicitly describe the fit of the clothing or use terms like "Crop Top" or "Fitted Bodysuit" to force the model to respect the character's underlying physique.
*   **Prompting:** "Do not alter bust, waist, or hip measurements" can sometimes work, but describing *fitted* clothing is often more effective at maintaining character consistency.

## Masterclass: The "151 Variations" Workflow (Video-to-Asset Pipeline)

### 1. The "Video Mine" Strategy
*   **Concept:** Instead of generating 100 static images and hoping for consistency, generate **one** video and extract 100 perfect frames.
*   **Technique:**
    1.  **Orbit:** "Camera orbits 360 degrees around [Character] while they stand still." -> Extract front, side, back, and 3/4 views.
    2.  **Walk Cycle:** "Full body shot of [Character] walking towards camera." -> Extract dynamic walking poses.
    3.  **Expression Bank:** "Close up on face, [Character] cycles through expressions: happy, sad, angry, surprised." -> Extract facial assets.
*   **Tooling:** Use Veo 3.1 or Kling for the video generation. Use a video player (like VLC or Chrome) to "Save Frame As" for the best assets.

### 2. The "Costume Transfer" Protocol
*   **Problem:** You have a character and a separate image of a costume (e.g., a beekeeper suit).
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  **Input 1 (Image Prompt):** The Costume Reference.
    2.  **Input 2 (Image Prompt):** A prop (optional, e.g., honeycomb).
    3.  **Base Image:** Your Consistent Character.
    4.  **Prompt:** "Put [Character] in this [Costume]. Keep the character's face exactly the same."
    5.  **Refinement:** If the face degrades, use the **MidJourney Editor** or **Nano Banana Inpainting** to paste the original face back onto the new costumed body.

### 3. The "Stitch Fix" for Faces
*   **Issue:** You have 5 variations of your character, but the faces are slightly "off" in 3 of them.
*   **Technique:**
    1.  Create a blank canvas in Photoshop/Canva.
    2.  Paste the "bad" images side-by-side with 1-2 "perfect" reference images.
    3.  **Img2Img Prompt:** "Side-by-side character sheet of the same boy. Fix the faces to match the reference."
    4.  **Why it works:** The model sees the "perfect" face in the context window and uses it as a ground truth to correct the distorted ones.

## Masterclass: The "Open Art" Consistency Protocol (Adapted)

### 1. The "Three-Tier" Character Creation
*   **Tier 1: Text Only (The Architect):** Start here. Define every detail: "Female alchemist, olive skin, curly black hair in messy bun, emerald eyes." Be specific to lock the seed concepts.
*   **Tier 2: Single Reference (The Anchor):** Once you have *one* perfect generation, use it as the "Anchor Image" for all future prompts.
*   **Tier 3: Multi-Reference (The Matrix):** For maximum stability, generate 8-10 images of the character (front, side, 3/4 view, close-up, full body). Feed *all* of them into the context window (or fine-tune a LoRA if available) to create a "bulletproof" character identity.

### 2. The "Character Weight" Concept
*   **Concept:** In tools like Open Art (and conceptually in Gemini prompts), you balance "Creativity" vs. "Consistency".
*   **Application:**
    *   **High Consistency (0.9):** "Keep face exactly consistent. Do not change features." -> Use for simple pose changes.
    *   **Lower Consistency (0.6):** "Same character but older/injured/different style." -> Allows the model flexibility to blend concepts while keeping the "vibe".

### 3. Multi-Character Interaction
*   **Challenge:** AI struggles to put two specific characters in one scene without blending them.
*   **Fix:**
    1.  **Generate Character A** on the left (transparent background or specific setting).
    2.  **Generate Character B** on the right.
    3.  **Composite** them roughly in Photoshop.
    4.  **Img2Img Pass:** "Two friends talking. [Character A description] on left, [Character B description] on right. Unified lighting."
    5.  **Result:** The model "glues" them together into a cohesive scene without blending their identities.

### 4. The "Camera Orbit" Animation Prompt
*   **Prompt Formula:** "Camera slowly orbits around [Character] as wind gently moves their hair. Cinematic lighting. High fidelity."
*   **Why:** Specifying *camera movement* (orbit, pan, zoom) + *environmental movement* (wind, rain) forces the video model to understand 3D depth, preventing the "flat image warping" effect.

## Masterclass: The "Storybook" Consistency Workflow

### 1. The "Memory Bank" Strategy
*   **Concept:** Don't rely on the model's short-term memory. Explicitly define and re-inject character data.
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  **Define:** Ask the model to generate a detailed character description (Appearance, Personality, Traits).
    2.  **Save:** Copy this description into a "Memory Bank" (a text file or pinned note).
    3.  **Inject:** For *every single prompt*, paste the full character description AND upload the reference image.
    4.  **Why:** "Always provide the appearance details again, even if you've saved them. It's better to be safe than sorry."

### 2. The "Scene Breakdown" Protocol
*   **Problem:** Asking for "Scene 1" often results in generic outputs.
*   **Technique:**
    1.  **Paste Story:** Feed the full story to the model.
    2.  **Breakdown:** "Break this story into 30 visual scenes."
    3.  **Pre-Visualization:** Before generating, ask: "Can you explain how you're going to create Scene 1? What details matter most?"
    4.  **Refine:** Read the explanation. If it misses the "star on the hoodie," correct it *before* generating the image.

### 3. The "Generative Expand" Ratio Fix
*   **Issue:** You generated a perfect square image, but you need 16:9 for a video.
*   **Fix:**
    1.  Do **NOT** try to stretch or crop it.
    2.  Open a 16:9 canvas in Photoshop (or use Nano Banana's "Outpainting").
    3.  Place the square image in the center.
    4.  **Prompt:** "Generative Fill" (or "Outpaint") to extend the background.
    5.  **Result:** You keep the perfect character consistency while getting the cinematic aspect ratio.

### 4. Expression Sheets for LoRA Training
*   **Concept:** If you need to train a custom model (Flux LoRA or similar), you need variety.
*   **Prompt:** "Give me 6 different facial expression sheets of this character in a 3:2 wide image ratio. [Happy, Sad, Angry, Surprised, Disgusted, Neutral]."
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  Generate the sheet.
    2.  Cut out each face.
    3.  Use these as the training dataset for your custom character model.

## Masterclass: Google Ecosystem & Traditional Art Secrets

### 1. The "Mixboard" Prototyping Method
*   **Tool:** Google Mixboard (Experimental).
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  **Brainstorming:** Upload your character. Type "Show this girl with different hairstyles."
    2.  **Layout:** It generates 3 variations. You can resize and group them on a canvas.
    3.  **Outfit Stacking:** Upload distinct items (e.g., "Pink Sneakers," "Orange Sunglasses," "Strapless Dress").
    4.  **Prompt:** "Girl wearing these items." (Tip: Combine all items into *one* single reference image before uploading to help the model understand the relationship).

### 2. The "Whisk" Precise Reference
*   **Tool:** Google Whisk (Labs).
*   **Feature:** "Precise Reference" toggle.
*   **Technique:**
    1.  Upload your character face.
    2.  Enable **Precise Reference**.
    3.  **Lock Seed:** If you get a style you like, lock the seed to generate variations (e.g., different aspect ratios) without losing the face.
    4.  **Editing:** Use the "Refine" tool to change background/lighting while keeping the subject locked.

### 3. Traditional Art Principles for AI
*   **Concept:** AI models are trained on art. Speaking the language of artists helps consistency.
*   **Prompting Tactics:**
    *   **Shape Language:** Describe the character's construction. "Face made of smooth round curves," "Sharp angular features," "Triangle shaped nose."
    *   **Distinct Features:** Give them a "glitch" or unique trait. "A scar on the left eyebrow," "Gap between front teeth." The model latches onto these anomalies as anchors for identity.
    *   **The "Model Sheet" Request:** explicitly ask for it. "Create a character model sheet with front, side, and back views. Neutral lighting. T-Pose."

## Masterclass: The "Traditional Art" Consistency Workflow

### 1. The "Shape Language" Foundation
*   **Concept:** AI models (like human artists) build faces from shapes.
*   **Prompting:** Don't just describe the face; describe the *geometry*.
    *   "Face constructed from soft round shapes."
    *   "Sharp, angular jawline with a triangular chin."
    *   "Big round nose, wide set eyes."
*   **Why:** This gives the model a "blueprint" to follow regardless of the angle.

### 2. The "Place and Trace" (Img2Img) Cheat
*   **Concept:** In animation, artists trace the previous frame to keep the model on-model. You can do this with AI.
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  **Base Image:** Take your perfect character generation.
    2.  **Rough Sketch:** Roughly sketch (or photoshop) the *new* pose you want over it (or next to it).
    3.  **Img2Img:** Upload this composite.
    4.  **Prompt:** "Refine this sketch into a finished drawing. Keep the character exactly as shown in the reference."
    5.  **Result:** The AI acts as the "cleanup artist," tightening your rough layout while adhering to the established character design.

### 3. The "Feeling" over "Math" Rule
*   **Insight:** "It matters more that the character *feels* true to the spirit than if the eyebrows are the right size."
    *   **Application:** If a generation is technically perfect but "feels" wrong, discard it. If it has a small error but captures the *soul* of the character, keep it and fix the error (inpainting/Photoshop).

## Masterclass: The "Manga Creation" Consistency Workflow

### 1. The "Panel Breakdown" Strategy
*   **Concept:** Use an LLM (Gemini/ChatGPT) to structure the visual storytelling *before* generating images.
*   **Prompt:** "Break down this story into 8-12 manga panels. Include clear visual prompt descriptions for each panel (camera angle, action, lighting). Keep dialogue separate."
*   **Why:** This ensures you have a cohesive visual plan and aren't just generating random cool images.

### 2. The "Black & White" Consistency Hack
*   **Concept:** Color introduces variables (lighting, skin tone shifts). Black and white reduces the variables, making consistency easier.
*   **Prompt Addition:** "...black and white manga style, high contrast ink work, dramatic composition, detailed character art."
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  **Character Creation:** Generate your character in this style first.
    2.  **Panel Generation:** Use the character reference + the panel description + the style prompt.
    3.  **Result:** A unified look that mimics professional manga ink work.

### 3. The "Canva Assembly" Line
*   **Concept:** Don't try to generate a full page at once. Generate panels, then assemble.
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  **Generate:** Create all 12 panels individually using your consistent character.
    2.  **Layout:** Use a tool like Canva (search "Comic Strip") to arrange the images.
    3.  **Lettering:** Add speech bubbles and text *after* the images are placed. This gives you control over the reading flow and dialogue placement.

## Masterclass: The "Google AI Studio" Direct Control

### 1. The "Environment Swap" Protocol
*   **Concept:** Nano Banana (Gemini) is exceptional at *editing* an image to place a subject in a new context without hallucinating a new face.
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  **Input 1:** Your "Base Character" image (Full body, clear lighting).
    2.  **Input 2:** The "Target Environment" image (e.g., a desert, a cyber city).
    3.  **Prompt:** "Place the woman from the first image into the desert background from the second image. Ensure she blends seamlessly with realistic scale and perspective. Match the lighting (e.g., golden hour) and shadows."
    4.  **Key:** Explicitly ask for "realistic scale" and "matching shadows" to avoid the "bad Photoshop" look.

### 2. The "Pose Transfer" (Reference Injection)
*   **Concept:** Force the model to adopt a specific pose using a reference, while keeping the identity locked.
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  **Input 1:** Base Character.
    2.  **Input 2:** Pose Reference (can be a stock photo, a sketch, or a 3D model).
    3.  **Prompt:** "Use the same woman as the first image, but change the pose to match the second reference photo. The face must remain identical to the first image."

### 3. The "Flat Lay" Outfit Transfer
*   **Concept:** You have a character and a photo of clothes (laid out flat on a bed/floor).
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  **Input 1:** Base Character.
    2.  **Input 2:** Photo of the outfit (Flat Lay).
    3.  **Prompt:** "Same woman, same pose. She is wearing the outfit from the second image [describe the items: pink t-shirt, denim shorts]. Face must remain identical."
    4.  **Result:** The model "drapes" the clothing onto the character realistically.

## Masterclass: Hybrid Tools & Animation

### 1. The "PoseMy.Art" Workflow
*   **Problem:** You can't describe a complex fighting pose or specific camera angle with words alone.
*   **Solution:**
    1.  Go to **PoseMy.Art** (free 3D poser tool).
    2.  Pose the mannequin exactly how you want.
    3.  Take a screenshot.
    4.  **Upload to Nano Banana** as a reference image.
    5.  **Prompt:** "Generate [Character] in exactly this pose. High angle, dynamic action."

### 2. The "Luma" Animation Pipeline
*   **Concept:** Static consistent characters are great, but video is better.
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  Generate your **Consistent Character** in a specific scene using the protocols above.
    2.  Upload this image to **Luma Dream Machine** (or Veo/Kling).
    3.  **Prompt:** "Camera slowly zooms in. Character breathes naturally. Wind blows hair." (Keep motion subtle to preserve face identity).
    4.  **Result:** A high-quality video clip of your consistent character.

### 3. The "Style Bender" Prompting
*   **Concept:** Once you have a character, you can "filter" them through different art styles without losing their core features.
*   **Prompt:** "Create [Character] in **Cubism** style." / "Create [Character] in **South Park** style." / "Create [Character] in **Rick and Morty** style."
*   **Use Case:** Creating "Multiverse" variants of your persona.

## Masterclass: The "Arc Ads" Commercial Pipeline (One-Shot Video)
*   **Concept:** Create a full commercial from a single image using Start/End frame logic.
*   **Tools:** Nano Banana (Gemini) + Arc Ads (Veo 3.1).
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  **Base Image:** Generate your influencer/character (Nano Banana).
    2.  **Product Integration:** Upload Base + Product Image. Prompt: "Character holding [Product] naturally."
    3.  **Keyframe Generation:**
        *   **Start Frame:** Character walking/talking.
        *   **End Frame:** Character sitting/drinking.
    4.  **Animation:** Upload both to Arc Ads (Veo). Prompt: "Character walks and talks about [Product]."
    5.  **Extension:** Take the last frame of Clip 1, use it as Start Frame for Clip 2. Prompt: "Character takes a sip."

## Masterclass: The "Frankenstein" Identity Stack (Ultimate Consistency)
*   **Concept:** Use the best specific tool for each layer of the image.
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  **Composition (MidJourney):** Generate the cinematic base image. Ignore the face/clothes accuracy. Focus on lighting/vibe.
    2.  **Face Swap (Ideogram):** Use Ideogram's "Magic Fill". Select the face. Upload User Reference. Prompt: "A man looking left..."
    3.  **Clothing Swap (Freepik/Seedream):** Use Freepik's "Reimagine/Seedream". Upload the Face-Swapped image as reference. Upload Clothing Reference. Prompt: "Swap clothes to match reference."
    4.  **Harmonization (Photoshop Beta):** Select subject -> Remove Background. Select Top Layer -> "Harmonize" to match lighting.

## Masterclass: The "Kling" Action Consistency
*   **Concept:** Use Nano Banana to "direct" the actor before filming.
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  **Base:** Generate character face/body.
    2.  **Pose Variation (Nano Banana):** Upload Base. Prompt: "Same girl, now pointing a bow at the camera." (Do this in steps: Zoom out -> Change Pose).
    3.  **Video Generation (Kling 2.5):** Upload the Posed Image. Prompt: "Cinematic shot, girl aiming bow, camera pushes in."
    4.  **Result:** Perfect character consistency because the *input image* already had the correct face and clothes in the correct pose.

## Masterclass: The "Freepik Spaces" Narrative Node Workflow
*   **Concept:** Use a node-based canvas (like ComfyUI but simpler) to map out an entire movie storyboard with consistent characters.
*   **Tool:** Freepik Spaces (Node-based).
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  **Setup:** Create a "Text Node" (Prompt) and an "Image Generator Node" (Nano Banana).
    2.  **Reference Injection:** Upload your "Anchor Character" image. Connect this image to the *Reference Image* input of the Generator Node.
    3.  **Prompting:** Connect the Text Node to the *Prompt* input.
        *   *Prompt Formula:* "Refer to attached image. Edit image to [Scene Description]. Keep same person's face, hair, physique exactly. Do not alter body proportions."
    4.  **Chaining:** Once you generate a scene you like (e.g., "Detective at Crime Scene"), use *that* output image as the reference input for the *next* node (e.g., "Detective arguing with Captain").
    5.  **Bird's Eye View:** You can see 10-20 scenes laid out on one infinite canvas, ensuring color grading and vibe flow correctly from shot to shot.

## Masterclass: The "26 Tests" Workflow (Advanced Consistency)
*   **Concept:** A rigorous testing framework for proving character lock across complex scenarios.
*   **Key Techniques:**
    1.  **Iterate Cheap, Finalize Expensive:** Use Nano Banana 1 (Gemini 2.5 Flash) for prompt engineering and composition testing (approx. $0.04/img). Only switch to Nano Banana Pro (Gemini 3 Pro) for the final high-fidelity render ($0.13-$0.24/img).
    2.  **The "Sword Screenshot" Hack:** If the model refuses to generate a specific prop (e.g., a specific sword), take a screenshot of *just* the prop from another tool (MidJourney), upload it as a reference, and connect it to the generator node.
    3.  **The "Smash Cut" Close-Up:** To get a perfect extreme close-up of your character's face without drift:
        *   Take your wide/medium shot.
        *   Crop it manually to just the face.
        *   Upload this crop as the *only* reference.
        *   Prompt: "Extreme close-up, high detail, cinematic lighting. Do not change expression."
    4.  **Body Composition Lock:** Nano Banana Pro is currently the *only* model that reliably maintains body type (e.g., muscular legs) without reverting to skinny/generic models, even when changing poses.
    5.  **The "Start & End Frame" Video Hack:**
        *   **Start Frame:** Character facing forward.
        *   **End Frame:** Character facing away (or new pose).
        *   **Video Gen:** Feed both into Veo/Kling to force the specific movement you want (e.g., "Camera whips around character").

## Masterclass: The "Veo 3" Consistency Protocol
*   **Concept:** Since Veo 3 doesn't support direct character reference images yet, you must use "Core Prompting" to lock identity.
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  **Whisk Analysis:** Generate a base character in Google Whisk. Drag the result to the "Subject" input to get a robust AI description of it.
    2.  **Gemini Core Prompt:** Feed the Whisk description into Gemini. Ask: "Create a detailed 'Core Prompt' for this character's physical appearance and a 'Voice Prompt' for how they speak."
    3.  **Prompt Injection:** Use this exact "Core Prompt" in *every single* Veo 3 generation.
    4.  **Caption Removal:** If Veo generates unwanted subtitles, use **CapCut's 'AI Remove'** tool (Video -> AI Remove) to erase them cleanly.
    5.  **Voice Cloning:** Take the best 10 seconds of audio from your generations, upload to **11Labs**, and clone the voice to fix accents or bad takes in other clips.
    6.  **Cost Hack:** Use "Veo 3 Fast" (20 credits) for most shots; it's often indistinguishable from "Quality" (100 credits) for standard scenes.

## Masterclass: The "ImageFX" Seed Lock (Free Consistency)
*   **Concept:** Use Google's free ImageFX tool to create consistent characters by locking the random seed.
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  **Prompt Structure:** "A [Age] year old [Nationality] [Gender], [Skin Tone], [Hair Style], wearing [Specific Outfit], [Expression], [Action/Pose], [Background]."
    2.  **Generation:** Generate your first character (e.g., "Kofi").
    3.  **Seed Locking:** Once you get a result you like, click the **"Lock Seed"** icon.
    4.  **Scenario Change:** Keep the character description *exactly* the same. Only change the `[Action/Pose]` and `[Background]` parts of the prompt (e.g., change "standing in a house" to "sitting under a tree").
    5.  **Multi-Character:** To put two consistent characters together, combine their descriptions in one prompt, ensuring you use the *exact* same descriptive phrases for each as you did in their solo shots.

## Masterclass: The "Firefly Board" Rotation
*   **Concept:** Use Adobe Firefly's "Boards" (infinite canvas) with the Gemini 2.5 Flash model to rotate characters perfectly.
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  **Setup:** Open Firefly Boards. Select "Gemini 2.5 Flash Image" as the partner model.
    2.  **Base:** Generate your character (e.g., "Anime character Zero fighting stance").
    3.  **Rotation:** Select the generated image -> Click "Edit with Gemini 2.5".
    4.  **Prompt:** "Rotate him 90 degrees." or "Rotate him 180 degrees." (Degrees work better than "side view").
    5.  **Pose Transfer:** Upload a line drawing or reference pose from Pinterest.
        *   *Prompt:* "Take the character from Image 1 and give him the pose from Image 2. Keep details intact."
    6.  **Color Edit:** Select the result -> Edit -> "Change glove color to black." (Nano Banana is precise enough to change just one item).

## Masterclass: The "Mixboard" Outfit Stacking
*   **Concept:** Use Google's experimental "Mixboard" tool to force a character to wear multiple specific items (e.g., specific dress + sneakers + glasses).
*   **Problem:** Uploading items separately often fails (AI ignores one or two).
*   **Solution:**
    1.  **Canvas Prep:** In Mixboard, drag your Character + Dress + Sneakers + Glasses onto the canvas.
    2.  **The "Single Image" Hack:** Instead of selecting them as separate references, **combine them into one image** (or select all and "Group" if supported, but best is to upload a single collage image of all items).
    3.  **Prompt:** "Girl wearing [Dress], [Sneakers], and [Glasses]."
    4.  **Result:** Nano Banana sees all items in the "single input" and applies them all correctly, whereas separate inputs often get dropped.

## Masterclass: The "Side-by-Side" Identity Lock
*   **Concept:** Generate a "Character Sheet" in one go to lock face and body details simultaneously.
*   **Prompt Formula:**
    > "Side-by-side photo of a close-up face and full body character design of [Character Description]. On the left: [Expression/Face Details]. On the right: [Outfit/Pose Details]. Captured in [Style/Lighting]."
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  **Generate Anchor:** Use the formula above to get a single image with both a face close-up and a full-body shot.
    2.  **Split & Upscale:** Crop the image into two: "Face Reference" and "Body Reference". Upscale them using Nano Banana ("Upscale this image").
    3.  **Consistency Generation:**
        *   Upload *both* the Face Reference and Body Reference.
        *   **Prompt:** "Front shot of the woman from Image 1. She is running through the desert from Image 2..."
    4.  **Result:** This "Dual Reference" technique forces the model to respect both the facial structure and the outfit details much more strictly than a single reference.

## Masterclass: The "Commercial Composite" Protocol
*   **Concept:** Using Nano Banana Pro for high-end advertising, product placement, and data visualization.
*   **Workflows:**
    1.  **The "Live Graph" Generator:**
        *   **Input:** A URL to a report or pasted text from a PDF.
        *   **Prompt:** "Create a bar graph/pie chart for this data. Style: Corporate, clean, 3D. Source: [Insert Source Name]."
        *   **Result:** Nano Banana renders perfect text and accurate data visualization from raw text inputs.
    2.  **The "Product Anchor" Shot:**
        *   **Input:** Image of a specific product (e.g., a camera gimbal, a perfume bottle).
        *   **Prompt:** "Place this [Product] in a luxury studio setting with cinematic lighting. Keep the product exactly as is. Add a person holding it naturally."
        *   **Power Move:** Use "Change background to..." to iterate on the setting without losing the product's likeness.
    3.  **The "Celebrity Context" Hack:**
        *   **Concept:** The model's deep knowledge of celebrities can be used to "anchor" the realism of your character.
        *   **Prompt:** "Generate a shot of [My Character] standing next to [Celebrity Name] (e.g., Fernando Alonso) in a garage. Both wearing [Specific Team Uniform]."
        *   **Why it works:** The model forces high-fidelity textures to match the celebrity, which bleeds over into your character's rendering.
    4.  **The "Triple Reference" Ad:**
        *   **Input:** Upload 3 images: 1. Your Avatar, 2. A Pet (e.g., specific puppy), 3. A Product.
        *   **Prompt:** "Use the uploaded avatar, puppy, and product exactly as shown. Avatar is holding the product, puppy is looking at it excitedly. Commercial lighting. High contrast."
        *   **Note:** This pushes the multi-modal attention to the limit but is powerful for complex scene composition.

## Masterclass: The "Open Art" Base & Environment Swap
*   **Concept:** Use a dedicated "Photorealistic" model (like Open Art or Flux) to create the *perfect* base image, then use Nano Banana Pro solely for consistency and editing.
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  **Base Generation:** Don't start in Nano Banana. Use Open Art (Photorealistic model) or Flux. Prompt simple: "25-year-old girl, white t-shirt, gray sweatpants, white background."
    2.  **Environment Integration:**
        *   **Inputs:** Upload Base Image + Background Image (e.g., Desert).
        *   **Prompt:** "Place the woman from Image 1 into the desert background from Image 2. Keep outfit exactly the same. Lighting: Warm, cinematic. Ensure seamless blend with realistic scale and shadows."
    3.  **Outfit Transfer (Flat Lay):**
        *   **Inputs:** Upload Base Image + Photo of clothes laid out flat.
        *   **Prompt:** "Same woman from Image 1. She is wearing the outfit from Image 2 (Pink t-shirt, denim shorts). Keep face identical."
    4.  **The "Text-Only" Swap:**
        *   **Input:** Base Image only.
        *   **Prompt:** "Change her outfit to a black leather jacket. Face must remain identical to reference."

## Masterclass: The "Camera Control" Protocol (One Image, Infinite Angles)
*   **Concept:** Turn a single "Foundational Image" into any camera angle by using specific cinematic terminology that the model recognizes.
*   **Reference:** See [CINEMATIC_PROMPT_LIBRARY.md](CINEMATIC_PROMPT_LIBRARY.md) for over 40 specific shot types and movements.
*   **The Foundational Image:** This is your "Source of Truth". It defines the character, lighting, and vibe.
*   **Angle Prompts (Upload Foundation as Reference):**
    *   **Bird's Eye:** "Direct overhead bird's eye view of Image 1. Show shadows stretching on the ground."
    *   **Dutch Angle:** "Dutch angle shot of Image 1. Dynamic composition."
    *   **Macro:** "Extreme close-up macro shot of Image 1's eyes/texture."
*   **Video Workflow (Veo 3.1):**
    *   **Technique:** Start & End Frame "Bridge".
    *   **Example (Rack Focus):**
        1.  **Start Frame:** Generate a blurry version of your character/scene.
        2.  **End Frame:** Your sharp Foundational Image.
        3.  **Bridge Prompt:** Ask Gemini/Claude: "Write a video prompt moving from this blurry frame to this sharp frame." (e.g., "Slow cinematic rack focus pull...").
        4.  **Generation:** Feed Start, End, and Prompt into Veo 3.1.

## Masterclass: The "AI Influencer" Pipeline
*   **Concept:** Building a "Viral" consistent avatar with hyper-realistic skin texture and social media versatility.
*   **Phase 1: The "Viral" Base Definition**
    *   **Strategy:** Don't guess. Ask the AI to define a viral look.
    *   **Prompt:** "Define a [Male/Female] character whose look has the potential to go viral on social media. Inspire by recognizable creators. Then, write a low-fidelity photo prompt for them shot against a clean white background in 'amateur photo camera style'."
    *   **Key Trick:** Use **"Amateur photo camera style"**. Avoid "iPhone" (prevents them holding a phone).
    *   **Refinement:** Generate a **"Close-Up Photo"** version immediately to capture high-res facial details for future consistency.
*   **Phase 2: Texture Injection (The "Enhancer" Step)**
    *   **Concept:** Nano Banana replicates what it sees. If your base has smooth "AI skin," every result will look fake. You must inject imperfections *first*.
    *   **Workflow:**
        1.  Take your Base Image.
        2.  **Edit/Upscale Prompt:** "Add raw skin texture, subtle imperfections, pores, slight asymmetry, unpolished skin. Hyper-realistic, 4K."
        3.  **Result:** A "Source of Truth" image with pimples, freckles, or texture. Use *this* for all future generations.
*   **Phase 3: Social Media Workflows**
    *   **The "Cooking Selfie":** Upload Source. Prompt: "POV of the woman taking a selfie as she's cooking food in the kitchen." (Maintains skin texture).
    *   **Virtual Try-On:** Upload Source + Photo of Clothing (Jacket). Prompt: "The woman from Image 1 wearing the jacket from Image 2. Fit: Natural, slightly oversized."
    *   **Campaign Mode:** Upload Source. Aspect Ratio: 16:9. Prompt: "High-fidelity professional campaign shot. Studio lighting. 85mm lens."
