## PART 1: MATERIAL SCIENCE DEEP DIVE

### The Adhesive Matrix (What Glues What)

**CRITICAL PRINCIPLE**: Every material pairing has an optimal adhesive. Wrong choice = failure at con.

#### Fabric-to-Fabric Bonding

| Fabric Type | Best Adhesive | Cure Time | Durability | Cost | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Cotton-to-Cotton | Fabric Fusion (permanent) | 24h | Excellent | $6 | Washable after cure |
| Stretch-to-Stretch | E6000 Fabri-Fuse | 24-72h | Excellent | $5 | Flexible bond crucial |
| Leather-to-Fabric | Barge All-Purpose Cement | 15min | Excellent | $15 | Professional grade |
| Synthetic-to-Cotton | Aleene's Fabric Fusion | 24h | Good | $4 | Budget option |
| Lace/Trim-to-Edge | Gem-Tac | 30min | Good | $6 | Precision applicator |

**Test Protocol for Each**:
1. Cut 2" x 2" swatches of both materials
2. Apply adhesive per manufacturer instructions
3. Cure FULL time (don't rush)
4. Stress tests: tug, sweat simulation (damp cloth), heat (blow dryer 30sec)
5. If survives all three → approved for costume

#### Foam-to-Material Bonding

| Base Material | Foam Type | Best Adhesive | Why | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| EVA Foam (cosplay armor) | 2-10mm sheets | Contact Cement (Barge, Weldwood) | Flexible, heat-resistant | $12-15 |
| EVA-to-Fabric | Any | E6000 or Contact Cement | Need flexibility + strength | $5-15 |
| EVA-to-EVA | Same | Contact Cement | Industry standard | $15 |
| Craft Foam (thin) | 2mm | Hot glue (low-temp) | Fast, forgiving | $3-8 |
| Expanding Foam (props) | Great Stuff | No glue needed (carve) | Structural core | $5-8 |

**EVA Foam Armor Protocol** (6-8 hours):
1. **Pattern & Cut** (1h): Print template, trace on foam, cut with X-Acto knife
2. **Heat Forming** (1-2h): Heat gun on medium (300°F), shape over forms/body, cool 5min
3. **Assembly** (2-3h): Apply contact cement to both surfaces, wait 5min until tacky, press firmly, hold 30sec
4. **Sealing** (1h): Coat in 3-5 layers Plasti-Dip (spray or brush), dry 20min between coats
5. **Painting** (2h): Acrylic base coat + details + dry brush weathering + clear seal
6. **Attachment** (30min): Velcro, elastic straps, or rare-earth magnets to undersuit

#### Paint-to-Surface Compatibility

| Surface | Paint Type | Primer Needed? | Sealer | Flexibility | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| EVA Foam | Acrylic | YES (Plasti-Dip) | Mod Podge or Clear Acrylic Spray | High | $15-25 total |
| Fabric (Cotton) | Fabric Paint | NO | Heat-set with iron | High | $8-12 |
| Fabric (Synthetic) | Acrylic + Fabric Medium | NO | Heat-set | Medium | $10-15 |
| Worbla | Acrylic | YES (Gesso or Primer) | Clear Coat | Low | $20-30 |
| 3D Prints (PLA) | Acrylic | YES (Filler Primer) | Clear Coat | None | $15-20 |
| Wood | Acrylic or Spray | Optional (speeds dry) | Polyurethane | None | $10-20 |

**Paint Durability Test**:
- Apply paint to test swatch
- Cure 48 hours minimum
- Bend test (for foam/fabric): flex 90° ten times
- Scratch test: fingernail firmly across surface
- Tape test: apply masking tape, press, rip off
- If paint stays intact → approved

### Fabric Selection by Character Archetype

**The Silhouette-Fabric Match**:

| Character Type | Silhouette Need | Fabric Choice | Why | Source | $/yard |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Flowing/Ethereal (Elsa, Frieren) | Drape + movement | Chiffon, Georgette, Silk Charmeuse | Catches light, flows naturally | Joann, Mood Fabrics | $8-20 |
| Sharp/Tailored (Makima, Levi) | Structure + crisp lines | Cotton Twill, Wool Blend, Suiting | Holds shape, presses clean | Fabric Wholesale Direct | $6-15 |
| Athletic/Skin-tight (Yoruichi, Spider-Gwen) | Stretch + recovery | 4-way Stretch Spandex, Athletic Knit | Moves with body, doesn't bag | Spandex World, Funkifabrics | $10-18 |
| Heavy/Armor (Esdeath, Storm) | Weight + presence | Faux Leather, Vinyl, Heavy Canvas | Reads as "substantial" | Amazon, Joann | $8-16 |
| Casual/Streetwear (Miles Morales, Deku) | Everyday texture | Cotton Jersey, Denim, Fleece | Looks "real," not costume | Thrift stores, Target | $0-10 |

**Budget Fabric Hierarchy** (when money is tight):
1. **Thrift entire garment** ($5-15) → Modify/dye if needed
2. **Bargain bin at fabric stores** ($2-5/yard) → End rolls, discontinued colors
3. **Walmart/Target basics** ($10-20) → Plain solid colors, modify with paint/trim
4. **Online bulk** ($6-12/yard) → Fabric Wholesale Direct, Spandex House
5. **Premium only for hero pieces** ($15-30/yard) → The one piece everyone photographs

## PART 3: DEEP-DIVE MODULE: ARMOR & HARD PROPS

### The 3-Track Armor System

**Track A: Beginner (Craft Foam + Hot Glue)** — 3-5 hours
- **Materials**: 2mm craft foam sheets, hot glue gun, acrylic paint
- **Best For**: Small armor pieces (bracers, shin guards, shoulder pads)
- **Process**: Print pattern → trace → cut → glue seams → paint
- **Cost**: $15-25

**Track B: Intermediate (EVA Foam + Contact Cement)** — 8-12 hours
- **Materials**: 5-10mm EVA foam, contact cement, heat gun, Plasti-Dip, acrylics
- **Best For**: Full chest plates, pauldrons, helmets, shields
- **Process**: Pattern → cut → heat-form → cement → seal → paint → attach
- **Cost**: $40-80

**Track C: Advanced (Worbla/Thermoplastics)** — 15-25 hours
- **Materials**: Worbla sheets, heat gun, Dremel, primer, automotive paint
- **Best For**: High-detail armor with sharp edges, smooth finish
- **Process**: Pattern → sculpt base → Worbla overlay → sand → prime → paint
- **Cost**: $100-200

### EVA Foam Armor: Step-by-Step (Intermediate Track)

**Week 1: Planning & Patterning (2-3 hours)**

1. **Reference Gathering**: Save 10-15 images of character's armor from multiple angles
2. **Identify Pieces**: Break armor into components (chest, back, shoulders, bracers, etc.)
3. **Pattern Selection**:
   - Free: Kamui Cosplay YouTube tutorials, Evil Ted Smith patterns
   - Paid: Kamui books ($20-30), Etsy templates ($5-15)
4. **Paper Mock-Up**: Print patterns at 100%, tape together, test fit on body
5. **Adjust Patterns**: Mark where it's too tight/loose, reprint, retest

**Week 2-3: Fabrication (6-8 hours)**

**Step 1: Material Prep**
- Buy EVA foam: 5mm for details, 10mm for base armor
- Tools: Sharp X-Acto knife, self-healing mat, metal ruler, heat gun, contact cement

**Step 2: Cutting**
```
For each armor piece:
1. Trace pattern onto foam with Sharpie
2. Cut with X-Acto knife (use SHARP blades, change every 2-3 cuts)
3. Score details (run knife lightly to create panel lines, don't cut through)
4. Bevel edges (45° angle cuts where pieces meet for seamless joins)
```

**Step 3: Heat Forming**
```
1. Set heat gun to 300-350°F (medium setting)
2. Wave heat gun 6-8 inches from foam, keep moving (prevents burn marks)
3. When foam becomes pliable (30-60 seconds), quickly shape over form
4. Hold shape until cool (2-5 minutes)
5. If shape isn't right, reheat and adjust
```

**Step 4: Assembly (Contact Cement)**
```
1. Apply thin layer to BOTH surfaces to be joined
2. Wait 5-10 minutes until cement is "tacky" (not wet)
3. Align pieces carefully (you get ONE SHOT)
4. Press firmly together, holder 30s
```

**Step 5: Sealing & Painting**
```
1. Seal: 3-5 coats of Plasti-Dip (wait 20min between)
2. Paint: Base acrylic coat -> Shadows (dark wash) -> Highlights (dry brush)
3. Seal: Clear acrylic spray
```

### Prop Weapons: Material Decision Tree

```
Need a weapon prop?
│
├─ Is it LONG (4+ feet) like staff, sword, spear?
│  ├─ YES → Core: PVC pipe or wood dowel ($3-8)
│  │         Wrap: EVA foam for details, paint ($10-15)
│  │         Total Time: 3-5 hours
│  └─ NO → Continue
│
├─ Is it DETAILED like gun, intricate blade?
│  ├─ YES → 3D print or carve from insulation foam
│  │         Paint with automotive primer + acrylics ($30-60)
│  │         Total Time: 8-15 hours
│  └─ NO → Continue
│
└─ SAFETY CHECK:
   - Con rules: No metal, sharps, realistic guns
   - Orange tip required for guns
   - Peace bonding mandatory

## PART 5: DEEP-DIVE MODULE: MAKEUP FOR ALL SKIN TONES

### The Foundation Matching Crisis

**Problem**: Cosplay tutorials default to pale skin.
**Solution**: Undertone-first matching + character adaptation.

**Undertone Test**: Green veins = Warm (Gold/Yellow). Purple/Blue veins = Cool (Red/Pink).

### Character Adaptation for Melanated Cosplayers

**Yoruichi Shihouin** (Melanated source):
- Match natural skin tone.
- Purple eyeshadow gradient, gold highlights.
- Sharp contour for feline features.

**Elsa / Makima** (Pale source):
- **Do NOT lighten skin.**
- **Elsa**: Use icy blues/silvers on eyes, cool-toned contour (grey-brown), silver highlighter.
- **Makima**: Match natural tone. Use deep red eyeshadow, sharp black wing, burgundy lip. Evoke the *power*, not the pigment.

### Durability Test
- **Sweat Test**: Wear for 1 hour active.
- **Flash Test**: Take photo with flash (check for "ghost face" from SPF foundation).
- **Setting**: Ben Nye Final Seal or Urban Decay All Nighter is mandatory.

---

## PART 6: PHOTOGRAPHY & POSING SYSTEM

### The 5-Pose System (Practice These)

1.  **Power Stance**: Feet wide, chest open, chin down. (Authority)
2.  **Dynamic Action**: One leg bent, twisting torso, hair in motion. (Energy)
3.  **Seated/Casual**: Triangle legs, leaning back. (Approachability)
4.  **The Signature**: The one iconic pose from the poster/anime. (Recognition)
5.  **Detail Close-Up**: Hold prop near face or highlight armor. (Craftsmanship)

### Editor's Note
- **Lighting**: Face towards light source. Shade/Cloudy is better than noon sun.
- **Editing**: Brightness/Contrast/Crop is standard. Altering body shape is controversial.

---

## PART 7: ACCESSIBILITY ADAPTATIONS

### Budget Tier System

- **$50 Build**: Thrift/Closet cosplay + DIY accessories. (Target: Makima, Casual Deku)
- **$100 Build**: Thrift/Buy Base + Mid-grade Wig + EVA Props. (Target: Yoruichi, Spider-Gwen)
- **$200 Build**: Full Commission or Premium materials. (Target: Armor builds, intricate gowns)

### Adaptive Cosplay (Disability Integration)

**Wheelchair-Accessible Modifications**:
1.  **Hemming**: Skirts at seat height to prevent tangling.
2.  **Mounting**: Attaching capes/props to chair frame, not body.
3.  **Integration**: Turning the chair into the Batmobile, Iron Throne, or Mecha cockpit.

**Sensory-Friendly Modifications** (Autism/SPD):
1.  **Fabric Texture**: Avoid burlap/stiff tulle. Substitute with **Jersey Knit, Modal, or lined Cotton**. Use "look-alike" fabrics that feel soft (e.g., printed texture vs actual rough texture).
2.  **Tag Removal**: Seamless undergarments or ripping out all manufacturing tags.
3.  **Compression**: Integrating compression vests/shorts under the costume for grounding.
4.  **Noise Control**: Incorporating noise-canceling headphones into the design (Cyberpunk, DJ Sona, or hidden under wigs/helmets).
5.  **Escape Plan**: Designated "quiet zones" at con and a "bail-out" changes of clothes accessible immediately.

---

## PART 8: GROUP DYNAMICS (The Squad Module)

### The "Harmonize, Don't Standardize" Rule
**Problem**: 5 friends, different budgets ($50 vs $500).
**Solution**:
1.  **Anchor Element**: Everyone uses the **same trim color** (e.g., all gold elements use the exact same spray paint).
2.  **Unified Texture**: Everyone agrees on "Matte" vs "Shiny" vinyl.
3.  **Level Matching**: The pro builder should *simplify* their build to match the group average, or help elevate the others. A squad with one movie-quality Batman and four pajama Robins looks worse than five mid-tier cosplayers.
