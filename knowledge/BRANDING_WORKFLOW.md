# $10,000 Brand Identity Design with Nano Banana (Imagen 3/Gemini 3)

*Based on "How to Design a $10,000 Brand with Google's Nano Banana AI"*

## Overview
This workflow demonstrates how to create a professional, agency-quality brand identity (Logo, Typography, Color Palette, Illustrations, Icons, and Mockups) in under an hour using AI tools.

## Tools Required
*   **Nano Banana (Gemini 3 / Imagen 3)**: For logo marks, icons, illustrations, and mockups.
*   **ChatGPT**: For naming, style analysis, and prompt generation.
*   **Recraft**: For vectorizing, assembling the brand board, and style consistency.
*   **Figma (Optional)**: For final assembly.

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### 1. Brand Foundation
*   **Naming**: Use ChatGPT to generate short, punchy names based on themes (e.g., "Bloom" for a finance app for young founders).
*   **Style Inspiration**: Find a reference brand (e.g., "Flex").
    *   *Technique*: Upload reference images to ChatGPT and ask it to describe the design style (e.g., "Minimalist modern graphic design, bold sans-serif, clean geometric shapes").
*   **Color Palette**: Use a generator (like Coolors) or extract from references. Aim for:
    *   1 Primary Color (e.g., Tiffany Blue).
    *   1 Secondary Color (e.g., Violet).
    *   Dark/Light shades for text and backgrounds.

### 2. Typography
*   **Selection**: Ask ChatGPT for "professional sans-serif fonts from Google Fonts" (e.g., Poppins, DM Sans).
*   **Hierarchy**:
    *   **Headings**: Bold/Semi-bold, tighter letter spacing.
    *   **Body**: Regular/Light, wider letter spacing.

### 3. Logo & Logo Mark
*   **Concept**: Ask ChatGPT for logo mark ideas (e.g., "Pixelated flower", "Abstract growth symbol").
*   **Generation (Nano Banana/Recraft)**:
    *   **Prompt**: "A logo mark of a pixelated flower in black on a transparent background."
    *   **Refinement**: Vectorize the output (SVG) to make it scalable and recolorable.

### 4. Custom Icons & Illustrations
*   **Style Consistency**: This is crucial for a premium look.
*   **Technique**:
    1.  Generate one perfect asset (e.g., a pixelated user icon) using Nano Banana or ChatGPT.
    2.  **Style Transfer**: Use that image as a **Style Reference** for subsequent generations.
    3.  **Prompt Structure**: "In exactly this style, create an icon of a [Wallet/Home/Crown] with a transparent background."
*   **Vectorize**: Convert all icons to vectors for the final brand kit.

### 5. Mockups
*   **Realism**: Place the brand in the real world to validate the look.
*   **Workflow**:
    1.  Find a high-quality base mockup image (e.g., Billboard, iPhone on desk).
    2.  **Nano Banana Prompt**: "Create a billboard mockup using the attached branding on the billboard image. Remove the content on the billboard and just show the brand logo."
    3.  *Tip*: Upload both the mockup template and the logo file as inputs.

## Deliverables Checklist
1.  **Logo**: Primary and Logo Mark (Vector).
2.  **Typography**: Heading and Body font selections.
3.  **Color Palette**: Hex codes for Primary, Secondary, Dark, Light.
4.  **Icon Set**: 5-10 consistent icons (Vector).
5.  **Illustrations**: 1-3 key brand illustrations.
6.  **Mockups**: 2-3 real-world applications (Mobile, Outdoor).

## Pro Tips
*   **"In Exactly This Style"**: Use this phrase in ChatGPT/Gemini when providing a reference image to force strict style adherence.
*   **Vectorization**: Always convert AI-generated logos/icons to SVG. Do not use raw rasters for final brand assets.
*   **Consistency**: Stick rigidly to the color palette. Don't introduce random new colors in illustrations.
