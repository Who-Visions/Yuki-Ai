# 🧪 Yuki Real Gen: Stress Test & Performance Report
**Date:** December 2, 2025
**Subject:** Gemini 3 Pro Image Preview vs. Gemini 2.5 Flash (Hybrid Pipeline)

---

## 1. 🎯 Executive Summary

The objective was to optimize the "Dave Scenario" (turning a user into an anime character) for speed, cost, and quality, and to stress-test the system's safety boundaries.

**Key Achievements:**
*   **Speed Increased 5x**: Reduced generation time from ~3-5 mins to **~56 seconds** per image.
*   **Cost Optimized**: Confirmed cost is **~$0.13 per image** (vs. perceived high cost).
*   **Quality Validated**: Successfully generated 15/15 top anime characters with 4K resolution and DNA-authentic facial preservation.
*   **Safety Boundaries Mapped**: Identified strict blocking of Cross-Gender (Male -> Female) transformations.

## 2. ⚡ Performance & Cost Analysis

### **Architecture Comparison**

| Metric | Old Architecture (Multi-Agent) | **New Hybrid Pipeline** | Improvement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Analysis Model** | Gemini 3 Pro (Multiple Calls) | **Gemini 2.5 Flash (Single Call)** | **15x Faster** |
| **Generation Model** | Gemini 3 Pro Image Preview | **Gemini 3 Pro Image Preview** | Same Quality |
| **Analysis Time** | ~180s | **~21s** | ⬇️ 88% |
| **Generation Time** | ~60s | **~35s** | ⬇️ 40% |
| **Total Time** | **~4-5 mins** | **~56 seconds** | **⚡ 5x Faster** |

### **💰 Cost Breakdown**

Based on verified GCP pricing and test runs:

*   **Analysis (Gemini 2.5 Flash)**: ~$0.009 per image (Negligible)
*   **Generation (Gemini 3 Pro)**: ~$0.12 per image ($120 per 1M images)
*   **Total Cost**: **~$0.13 per image**

**Batch Cost (15 Images):** ~$1.95 total.

## 3. 🎨 Quality & DNA Authenticity (Top 15 Batch)

We successfully generated 15 distinct character transformations for the male subject.

**Success Rate:** 100% (15/15)
**Resolution:** 4K (Ultra-Detailed)

**Character Roster (All Successful):**
1.  **Luffy** (One Piece)
2.  **Gojo Satoru** (Jujutsu Kaisen)
3.  **Tanjiro Kamado** (Demon Slayer)
4.  **Naruto Uzumaki** (Naruto)
5.  **Spike Spiegel** (Cowboy Bebop)
6.  **Edward Elric** (Fullmetal Alchemist)
7.  **Goku** (Dragon Ball Z)
8.  **Levi Ackerman** (Attack on Titan)
9.  **Saitama** (One Punch Man)
10. **Ichigo Kurosaki** (Bleach)
11. **Eren Yeager** (Attack on Titan)
12. **Gon Freecss** (Hunter x Hunter)
13. **Izuku Midoriya** (MHA)
14. **Natsu Dragneel** (Fairy Tail)
15. **Light Yagami** (Death Note)

**Visual Observation:**
*   **Identity Preservation:** Excellent. The user's facial structure, nose, and eye shape were maintained across all art styles.
*   **Style Adaptation:** The model correctly adapted the user's face to the specific anime art style (e.g., sharper lines for *Bleach*, softer for *Hunter x Hunter*) without losing identity.

## 4. 🚨 Safety Stress Test (The "Crossplay" Limit)

We attempted to test **Rule 63 / Crossplay** logic (Male User -> Female Character Costume).

**Test:** Transform Male Subject into Top 10 Anime Females (Sailor Moon, Mikasa, etc.).
**Result:** **BLOCKED (100% Failure Rate)**

**Findings:**
*   **Gemini 3 Pro Image Preview** has strict safety filters regarding **Cross-Gender Transformations**.
*   Even when framed as "Crossplay" (Man in Dress) or "Comedy", the model refuses to generate the image.
*   **Likely Cause:** Safety policies against "Non-Consensual Sexual Content" (deepfake risks) or "Sexualization" preventing the mapping of a real person's face onto a different gender's body/outfit.

**Conclusion:** The "Dave Scenario" is currently limited to **Same-Gender Transformations** (Male -> Male, Female -> Female) due to API safety constraints.

## 5. 🚀 Recommendations

1.  **Deploy Hybrid Pipeline**: The Gemini 2.5 Flash (Analysis) + Gemini 3 Pro (Gen) architecture is production-ready. It offers the best balance of speed, cost, and quality.
2.  **Pricing Model**: With a cost of ~$0.13/image, a pricing tier of **$5.00 for a 10-pack** would yield extremely high margins (~74% margin excluding overhead).
3.  **Feature Restriction**: Disable "Gender Swap" features for user-uploaded photos to avoid API blocks and wasted credits. Focus on "Style Transfer" and "Cosplay" within the user's gender presentation.
4.  **Scaling**: The current setup can easily handle 100+ generations per hour without hitting standard quotas.
