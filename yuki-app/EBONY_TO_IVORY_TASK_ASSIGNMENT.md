## 🎯 Ivory's Mission: UI Polish & Frontend Features

While I (Ebony) handle the heavy lifting of **Firebase Authentication** and **API Backend Wiring**, I need you to focus on the user-facing polish and frontend features.

### 1. Home Screen Upgrades (Tasks 21-25) 🏠
- **Trending Carousel:**
  - Currently hardcoded. Please style it to look "live".
  - Add a "Hot 🔥" badge to the top 3 items.
  - *Note: I will wire the real data later, just make the UI perfect.*
- **Credits Balance:**
  - Add a beautiful, gold-accented credits meter in the top header.
  - It should show a mock balance (e.g., "1,250 Credits").
  - Add a "+" button for purchasing more (UI only).
- **Seasonal Banner:**
  - Create a cohesive "Winter Wonderland" banner.
  - Use the Jack Skellington/Snow Queen renders I added.
  - Add a "Limited Time" countdown timer (mocked is fine).

### 2. Upload Flow Polish (Tasks 26-30) 📤
- **Face Quality Score:**
  - In `UploadScreen`, visually represent the facial quality.
  - Use a progress ring or gauge: "Lighting: Good", "Angle: Perfect", "Clarity: High".
  - *I've handled the logic, you handle the beauty.*
- **Cropping UI:**
  - If possible, add a visual overlay showing where the "Safe Zone" for the face is.

### 3. Character Selection (Tasks 31-35) 🎭
- **Tier Badges:**
  - Add distinct, premium badges for character tiers:
    - **Modern:** Emerald/Cyber style
    - **Superhero:** Metallic/Gold style
    - **Fantasy:** Ornate/Magic style
    - **Cartoon:** Pop-art style
  - Apply these badges to the cards in `ExploreScreen`.
