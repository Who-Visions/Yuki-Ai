- Add **tape** or **stickers** as minimal coverage
- Position **hair strands** strategically
- Use **arm placement** to cover

### Strategy 2: Costume Adaptation
- Add a **thin strap** or **minimal bikini top** that wasn't in original
- Use **body paint** or **temporary tattoos** as "coverage"
- Employ **clever lighting** and **shadows**

### Strategy 3: Camera Angles
- **Side angles** that show sensuality without explicit exposure
